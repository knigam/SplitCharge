# SplitCharge
## Goal
* Split payments across friends
* Keep track of past group payments
* Instantly charge all friends thier respective amounts

## What works now
* Ability to create charges
* Ability to add people to the charges
* Ability to add multiple items with different costs to each person
* Ability to add items for a charge that are split across people (evently or by percent)

## Coming soon
* Save charge to SQLite database
* See history of charges with the ability to recharge people

## Plans for the near future
